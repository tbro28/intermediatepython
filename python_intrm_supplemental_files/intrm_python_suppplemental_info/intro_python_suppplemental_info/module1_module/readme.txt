2 ways to make test_module1.py to work:
1. put both test_module1.py and module1.py in the same folder
2. put both test_module1.py and module1.py in the different folder.
for example module1.py which is the module is put in c:\pythonxx folder
set  the environment variable PYTHONPATH to c:\pythonxx 
PYTHONPATH=.;c:\pythonxx
